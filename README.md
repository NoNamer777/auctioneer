# Auctioneer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v12.1.2.
It uses Bootstrap and additional Font Awesome icons.

## Development server

Run `ng start:local` for a dev server. 
Run `ng start:remote` for a dev server that is available within your local network. Be sure to check your device's IP configuration first before running the script and change the targetted host accordingly, otherwise you'll run into some errors.

You'll also need to update the `src/environments/environment.dev.ts` to your needs. You can find an example in the `src/environments/environment.ts`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
